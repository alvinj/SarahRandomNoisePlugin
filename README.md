Sarah 'Random Noise' Plugin
===========================

Add this plugin to Sarah to enable random sounds to be played.
(You'll also need to add some configuration files ... somewhere.
I'll document that more over time.)


Developers
----------

* To create a jar file, see the script in the deploy/ directory.
* You should also be able to create a jar file more easily now
  by running `sbt package`, but i haven't tested that yet.
