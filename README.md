Sarah 'Random Noise' Plugin
===========================

Add this plugin to Sarah to enable random sounds to be played.
It actually (a) plays sound clips and (b) 'speaks' text/sentences
you supply at random times.

You can control the time delay, though I (sadly) haven't documented
that here yet. (I'm just trying to get all this code into Github today
before I have to move on to something else.)


Developers
----------

* To create a jar file, see the script in the deploy/ directory.
* You should also be able to create a jar file more easily now
  by running `sbt package`, but i haven't tested that yet.
